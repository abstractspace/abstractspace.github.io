I'm a 25 year old man, and my primary occupation is being a husband to my wife and a dad to my seven month old son. This is all kind of new to me.

I work as an electrical engineer to support my primary occupation. This is my first job since graduating college. It's also kind of new to me.

I've been a student for most of my life up until now, and I feel like I had adjusted to being a student very well.

Now God has gone and changed everything up on me, and that's a good thing.
