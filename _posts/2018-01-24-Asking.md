I just read Matthew 7:7-8

>Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks it will be opened.

How often do we not ask? I often find myself wanting a closer relationship with God, yet not really wanting. Wanting in the sense of "wouldn't it be nice if I were taller, or smarter". These things have an air of sounding "nice" to me, but I wouldn't say I am actively pursuing them. In the same way it seems "nice" to be closer to God, but I'm not pursuing it in the way I should be. I need to actually ask.
